Example project showing how an immersive scene on visionOS can contain a [RealityView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/realityview/) that presents a [ModelEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/modelentity) and how that entity can be dragged using [DragGesture](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/draggesture) and rotated using [RotateGesture](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/RotateGesture).
